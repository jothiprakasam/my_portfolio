        It's a pleasure to share my experience in NodeJS and MongoDB, both are
        very interesting to learn and doing projects. My project is simply based
        on message posting, which is stored in MongoDB Compass, and I used the
        mongoose npm package. User registration details and login credential
        verification are simple features in my website.
